          <p><span class="highlight">Alpha Phi Omega </span>is a national coeducational service organization founded on the principles of <span class="highlight"> Leadership, Friendship, and Service. </span>We provide members with the opportunity to develop leadership skills as volunteers on their campus, in the community, to the nation, and to the organization. With more than 400,000 members on over 375 campuses, Alpha Phi Omega continues to provide more service on more campuses than any other collegiate organization.<br><br>Furthermore, the very core of our organization distinctly separates us from other fraternities:<span class="highlight"> Scout's Oath. </span>Alpha Phi Omega is closely modeled after the Boy Scouts of America, our greatest goal being the continuation of Scout traditions in collegiate lives and beyond. Though our organization no longer requires mandatory Scout participation, our initiation process ensures that all members preserve the philosophy of the Boy Scouts of America.</p>

          <p>Alpha Phi Omega teaches us through our Cardinal Principles of Leadership, Friendship, and Service that we are the architects of our own ambitions and that each of us has the opportunity to develop ourselves to be whatever we seek to be. In the area of leadership, from within our own fraternity, people are transformed from followers to leaders sometimes without really being aware of the development. It can happen gradually, or it might happen overnight - today a follower, tomorrow a leader.</p>

          <p>Though Alpha Phi Omega may sound serious, we are still very much like a fraternity. We want all of our members to develop a sense of brotherhood through shared experiences and an understanding of one another. Brotherhood is the spirit of friendship. It implies, respect, honesty, and dependability. It means we overlook differences and emphasize similarities as we join together in unselfish services. Members of our organization are able to participate in a multitude of social events sponsored by our chapter and by the national office. These events range from small get-togethers to grand conventions hosted at the regional level. Alpha Phi Omega strongly supports active networking.</p>

          <p>Our chapter service program provides opportunities for the development of social awareness, friendships and leadership skills. Participation in our service programs helps make Alpha Phi Omega the unique fraternal organization it is. The Fraternity has established four fields of service in which chapters should be involved in. These are: Service to the Campus, Service to the Community, Service to the Nation, and Service to the Fraternity.</p>

          <p>In order to fulfill our purpose of building leaders in service and friends to the community, we strive to network with local institutions and like-minded organizations. In doing so, we foster bonds that our brothers may use to develop the necessary skills to flourish academically, socially, and athletically. These bonds manifest themselves as volunteer work ranging from manual labor to logistic management.</p>

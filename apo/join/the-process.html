          <p><span class="highlight">Zeta Omicron</span> is the name of our local chapter for Alpha Phi Omega. We call San Luis Obispo our home. We call Cal Poly our home. Joining our organization is reminiscent of the fraternity process. We hold <span class="highlight">rush events</span> followed by a period of time called <span class="highlight">pledging</span>. Successful completion of this process grants official membership. Thought not everyone will succeed, this process ensures that those that do are qualified people with like-minded aspirations. If interested, read on!</p>

          <p>Our rush week begins during the first week of the <span class="highlight">Fall</span> and <span class="highlight">Spring</span> quarters. We hold various events that preview the main activities of our chapter. Also, this is when we have our brothers actively showcasing Alpha Phi Omega in the UU or on Dexter Lawn. If you've never rushed a fraternity before, think of this as "testing the waters."</p>

          <p>If after you've tested the waters and you decided it was just right (pardon the pun), then this process would be like learning how to swim. While not much can be said about this quarter-long process (pledging is secret), two things are guaranteed. The very first guarantee is that there is no hazing whatsoever. It is nationally enforced and written in our bylaws. The second guarantee is that you will come out a better person. There are hardships, but speak to any brother, and they will say the same thing: <span class="highlight">"I'm glad I followed through."</span></p>
